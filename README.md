# Remita Direct Debit API Implementation

### Remita API Setup for implementing Direct Debit 

- It consist of all the required or needed functions for setting up Remita Direct Debit
- It also includes Remita test endpoints and credentials
- Coded in PHP, Jquery & Ajax
- Database file "remita.sql" is included and required because I stored customers information required for setting up mandate
- I made use of material design-"MDB"-for great UX
